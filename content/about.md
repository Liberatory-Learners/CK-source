# About

Born in New Zealand and raised in Singapore, Cosmic Kitty (C.K) is a queer POC hybrid multidisciplinary artist who creates music, filmic narratives, theatrical comedic absurdist plays, interactive games and performance art that challenges the inter-connectivity between lineage, knowledge and creation. Her work confronts capitalism and its hold on the subconscious in relation to building intimacy and vulnerability between people. Her chapbook ATOA: A Meditative Poem Through the Alphabet won the Southeast Review Editors Choice Chapbook Competition. She received an MFA in Writing from Pratt Institute and an MA in Community Development and Planning from Clark University where she also completed her B.A in Theatre Arts and Women and Gender Studies. Her folk synth album â€œEverything is Pencil" that critiques the fast-food-pharmaceutical-prison-plastic slave driven war machine is now available on Spotify under Ana Not Ana. 


## Founder & Mission
She is the creator of Titties and Liberatory Learners, an international interdisciplinary playspace on a mission to end poverty, homelessness, war, slaughterhouses and slavery by creating global healing hubs that promote community recycling initiatives, interdisciplinary upcycling workshops focused on literacy, transformation and movement through dance, yoga and free rave spaces.
