*What is Titties?*

Titties For Change is a Research Hub Dedicated to Ending Plastic Production Forever Through the Study of Utopian Ideas, Independent Thought, and the Imagination.

We are based in Brooklyn, New York. We host vegan plastic-less pot lucks and open mics.

We sometimes dance on the street together.

We are anti-war, anti-plastic, vegan art collective that creates hybrid spaces to educate, re-create, entertain, heal, and transform to find long term solutions to plastic production, homelessness, poverty, slavery and war by shifting rhetoric from “impossible” to “possible” by changing the world through expression, creative projects, and community outreach.

Note: We are no longer on social media as of 2022.


> *"The body is like an earth. it is a land unto itself. It is as vulnerable to overbuilding, being carved into parcels, cut off, overmined, and shorn of its power as any landscape. The wilder woman will not be easily swayed by redevelopment schemes. For her, the questions are not how to form but how to feel. The breast in all its shapes has the function of feeling and feeding. Does it feed? Does it feel? It is a good breast."*
